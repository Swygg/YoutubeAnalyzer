# YoutubeAnalyzer
Youtube scapper

Ok, I don't use to work a lot with github, so please forgive me if you don't find the answer/informations you are looking for.

My goal with that project is to create a simple Youtube webscraper in order to find : 
- Informations about a youtube video (name, publication date, nb of viewer, number of likes/dislikes...)
- Informations about a youtube account/channel
- Informations about a playlist

All of that just for fun and glory :D

Code will be in C#.
I want to use old Windows Form for now, because it's ugly, so it's fun.
Later I will make an API with that.

Have fun and see you :)
